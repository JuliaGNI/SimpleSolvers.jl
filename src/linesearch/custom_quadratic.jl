    QuadraticState2 <: LinesearchState

Quadratic Polynomial line search. This is similar to [`QuadraticState`](@ref), but performs multiple iterations in which all parameters ``p_0``, ``p_1`` and ``p_2`` are changed. This is different from [`QuadraticState`](@ref) (taken from [kelley1995iterative](@cite)), where only ``p_2`` is changed. We further do not check the [`SufficientDecreaseCondition`](@ref) but rather whether the derivative is *small enough*.

This algorithm repeatedly builds new quadratic polynomials until a minimum is found (to sufficient accuracy). The iteration may also stop after we reaches the maximum number of iterations (see [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS_FOR_QUADRATIC_LINESEARCH`](@ref)).

# Keywords

- `config::`[`Options`](@ref)
- `ε`: A constant that checks the *precision*/*tolerance*.
- `s`: A constant that determines the initial interval for bracketing. By default this is [`DEFAULT_BRACKETING_s`](@ref).
- `s_reduction:` A constant that determines the factor by which `s` is decreased in each new *bracketing iteration*.
