Examples include [`StaticState`](@ref), [`Backtracking`](@ref), [`Bisection`](@ref) and [`Quadratic`](@ref).
See these examples for specific information on linesearch algorithms.

# Extended help

A `LinesearchMethod` always goes together with a [`LinesearchState`](@ref) and each of those [`LinesearchState`](@ref)s has a functor implemented:

```julia
ls(obj, α)
```
where obj is a [`AbstractUnivariateObjective`](@ref) and `α` is an initial *step size*. The output of this functor is then a final step size that is used for updating the parameters.

    Backtracking <: LinesearchMethod

The *backtracking* method.

# Constructors

```julia
Backtracking()
```

# Extended help

The backtracking algorithm starts by setting ``y_0 \gets f(0)`` and ``d_0 \gets \nabla_0f``.

The algorithm is executed by calling the functor of [`BacktrackingState`](@ref).

The following is then repeated until the stopping criterion is satisfied or `config.max_iterations` ([`MAX_ITERATIONS`](@ref) by default) is reached:

```julia
if value!(obj, α) ≥ y₀ + ls.ϵ * α * d₀
    α *= ls.p
else
    break
end
```
The stopping criterion as an equation can be written as:

```math
f(\alpha) < y_0 + \epsilon \alpha \nabla_0f = y_0 + \epsilon (\alpha - 0)\nabla_0f.
```
Note that if the stopping criterion is not reached, ``\alpha`` is multiplied with ``p`` and the process continues.

[Sometimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search) the parameters ``p`` and ``\epsilon`` have different names such as ``\tau`` and ``c``.

    Bisection <: LinesearchMethod

The *bisection* method.

# Constructors

```julia

# Extended help

The bisection algorithm starts with an interval and successively bisects it into smaller intervals until a root is found.
See [`bisection`](@ref).
